# Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation

This is a simple U-NET Model implementation using Pytorch, capable of segmenting the blood vessels in the human retina. The model was implemented and trained using Google Colab and can be used as a tool for ophthalmic research, clinical decision support, and drug development and testing.
 
 The segmentation of blood vessels in the human retina can be used in a number of applications, including:
 - Diagnosis and monitoring of eye diseases: Blood vessel segmentation can help in the early detection and monitoring of eye diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and age-related macular degeneration.
 - Ophthalmic research: Blood vessel segmentation can aid in the research of eye diseases and help in the development of new treatments and therapies.
 - Clinical decision support: Blood vessel segmentation can be used to support clinical decision making, such as the diagnosis and progression of eye diseases.
 - Drug development and testing: Blood vessel segmentation can be used in the development and testing of drugs for eye diseases.
 - Telemedicine: Blood vessel segmentation can be used in telemedicine to remotely diagnose and monitor eye diseases, particularly in areas where access to specialized medical care is limited.
